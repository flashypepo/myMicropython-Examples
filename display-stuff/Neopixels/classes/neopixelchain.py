# NeoPixel chain class.  Allows you to concatenate multiple NeoPixel objects
# into one long chain with the same interface (get, set, fill, write).  Great
# for when you have disparate sets of pixels that need to act like one long
# chain.

# Example usage:
#   import neopixel
#   import neopixelchain
#   # Construct your neopixels objects:
#   np1 = neopixel.NeoPixel(...)
#   np2 = neopixel.NeoPixel(...)
#   np3 = neopixel.NeoPixel(...)
#   # Create the chain by passing all the neopixel objects to the initializer:
#   chain = neopixelchain.NeoPixelChain(np1, np2, np3)
#   # The chain has the same interface as the NeoPixel object:
#   chain.fill((0,0,0))
#   chain.write()
#   chain[0] = (255, 0, 0)             # First pixel red
#   chain[chain.n//2] = (0, 255, 0)    # Middle pixel green
#   chain[chain.n-1] = (0, 0, 255)     # Last pixel blue
#   chain.write()
